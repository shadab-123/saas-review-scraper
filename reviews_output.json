The app is super buggy and there is NO customer service. Salesforce seems to barely know they own Slack and it all goes to a email support team who goes back and forth and gets nothing done. I am looking for an alternative after 3 years of being with them because this is absolutely terrible."

It was 50% off for the first months or $4.49 something per month. It wanted to charge me around $8.99 the first month. Several times i refreshed and same thing happened."

Since then the channel had been deactivated by the organization and I am still getting charged even though there are no active users, additionally there is nowhere to downgrade, AND I contacted customer support about it a month ago and they continue to charge me anyways. Why cant companies create products people want to use instead of just scamming people for profit? I've contacted my credit card company to dispute the charges, next step is a new ordering a new card since they are determined to continue charging me despite not using the service and my requests. I noticed several others on reddit with the same experience."
